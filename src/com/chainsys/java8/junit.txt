+ JUnit 
	+ JUnit is an open source unit testing framework for Java 
	+ It is important for test driven development
	+ and is a family of unit testing frameworks collectively -  xUnit.
+ Features
	+ It allows to write code faster - which increases quality
	+ annotations - to identify test methods
	+ Test runners to run the test automatically
	+ color bars : green : TC pass; red : TC fail
+ JUnit Framework
	+ Test fixtures
	+ Test suites
	+ Test Runners
	+ JUnit classes	
+ Fixtures
	+ fixed state of a set of objects used as a baseline for running tests. 
	The purpose of a test fixture is to ensure that there is a well-known and fixed environment in which tests are run so that results are repeatable. 
	It includes
		+ setUp() method, which runs before every test invocation.@BeforeClass
		+ tearDown()method, which runs after every test method.@AfterClass
		
+ Test Suites
	+ If we want to execute multiple test cases, all are combined in same class@Suite

+ JUnit Classes
	+ used to writing and testing JUnits
		+ Assertions - validating expected output with actual output
		+ TestCase
		+ TestResult
