 +  StandardOpenOptions enums are supported:

		WRITE – Opens the file for write access.
		APPEND – Appends the new data to the end of the file. This option is used with the WRITE or CREATE options.
		TRUNCATE_EXISTING – Truncates the file to zero bytes. This option is used with the WRITE option.
		CREATE_NEW – Creates a new file and throws an exception if the file already exists.
		CREATE – Opens the file if it exists or creates a new file if it does not.
		DELETE_ON_CLOSE – Deletes the file when the stream is closed. This option is useful for temporary files.
		SPARSE – Hints that a newly created file will be sparse. This advanced option is honored on some file systems, such as NTFS, where large files with data "gaps" can be stored in a more efficient manner where those empty gaps do not consume disk space.
		SYNC – Keeps the file (both content and metadata) synchronized with the underlying storage device.
		DSYNC – Keeps the file content synchronized with the underlying storage device.
		Folder SubFolder Creation
