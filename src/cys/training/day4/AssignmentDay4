Write a program that reads an array of ints and outputs the length of the
longest sequence in strictly ascending order. Print the elements of longest
ascending sequence in an array Elements of the sequence must go one after
another. A single number is assumed to be an ordered sequence with the length= 1.

Enter the number of elements 
5
Enter 5 numbers in any order to find the longest ascending sequence

45
40
0
39

Write a program to find the Fascinating number
/*
327×2=654

327×3=981

Now, concatenate the above results to the given number (n).

"327"+"654"+ "981"= 327654981

We observe that the resultant () contains all the digits from 1 to 9, exactly once. 
Hence, the given number 327 is a fascinating number.*/
