Create a class with a method that prints "This is parent class" and its subclass with another method that prints "This is child class".
Now, create an object for each of the class and call
1 - method of parent class by object of parent class
2 - method of child class by object of child class
3 - method of parent class by object of child class
4 - method of child class by object of parent class

declare the method of the parent class as private and then repeat the first two operations

Data members
1 - Name

Two classes 'Employee' and 'Manager' inherits the 'Member' class. 
The 'Employee' and 'Manager' classes have data members 'specialization' and 'department' respectively.
