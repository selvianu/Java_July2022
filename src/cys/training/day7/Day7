//Encapsulation-hiding the data
//Overloading - methods with same name and different args
//Abstraction - hiding the implementation
2 ways - abstract class and interface
- One way - abstract method - method with/without method definition
if any one method is abstract, then the entire class becomes as abstract
Other way - Interface
