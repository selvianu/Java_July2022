Encapsulation
Overloading

Abstraction - hiding the implementation
2 ways - Abstract class
some methods - may not methods definitions - declare those methods as "abstract"
abstract methods --> abstract class --> may or maynot have abstract methods
abstract methods-->abstract class.-->objec cant be created(bcoz abstract  - incomplete)
extend to the Child class, where i can implement then abstract / unimplemented methods
child class object - access
you can override/rewrite the parent class methods in child class
extends --> class to class / interface to interface


Interface - all unimplemented method
no constructor
can't be instantiated

method declarations- no method definitions
Create a class and implement the interface - "implements"
